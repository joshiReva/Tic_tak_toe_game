How to Play
The game consists of a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 uses "X" and Player 2 uses "O".
Players take turns clicking on the empty squares.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
